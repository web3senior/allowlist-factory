## Overview
‚ú® This <span style="color:cyan">smart contract</span> provides a secure and transparent way to manage whitelist access for minting NFTs by using **<span style="color:gold">Unified API</span>** & **<span style="color:gold">GoldRush Kit.</span>**

### Advantages

**Fair and secure NFT distribution:** Prioritize specific users (e.g., early supporters, community members) by granting them exclusive access to mint NFTs before the public sale.

**Reduce gas fee:** Reduce transaction fees by limiting initial minting to whitelisted addresses.

**Increase community engagement:** Encourage participation in community activities or social media engagement as criteria for whitelisting.

**Transparency and immutability:** All whitelist data is stored on the blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof records and open visibility.
